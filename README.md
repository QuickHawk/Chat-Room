# Simple Chat Room

A simple experiment to understand how a chat room works.

Here, `server.py` manages the all the socket connections, and sending of messages. And  `client.py` manages the printing of text. 
`client.py` uses `tkinter` library to open an application window to continue chating.

## Learning

* Understood how sockets work.
* Implementation of GUI based applications.
* Handling of clients and broadcasting of messages.

## Shortcomings

* Only a single chat-room.
* No password protection as there is no centralized hub.
* Only works on local.
